Round 2 of xenon stack

I have created ecommerce website . It is an Airbnb model for hotels, providing users with a user-friendly website to book accommodations in a wide range of hotels worldwide.
For fronted I preferred the most commonly used languages like HTML, CSS, Javascript.
For backend I used NodeJs, Express, EJS.
For Database I used MongoDB.

Note: As I have created  a  dynamic  website and GitHub supports static projects for hosting (GitHub basically host projects which contains HTML file) so my site need domain for it which I cannot find for free.
It is not possible to get input from the user if hosted on GitHub.



Screen 1:-
The very first page of my site.
